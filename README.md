# REST API with Flask and Python
## Credit: Jose Salvatierra - Teclado

### About this repo:
This simple REST API serves as my own springboard for other projects.  It implements Flask, RESTful architecture, user authentication, SQL and SQLAlchemy, Heroku, nginx, DNS, SSL, and token refreshing.

### Setting things up:

Using PIPENV virtual environment with the following dependencies:
1. `$ pipenv install Flask`
2. `$ pipenv install Flask-RESTful`
3. `$ pipenv install Flask-JWT`

Once virtual environment is initialized and set up with our dependancies, remember to launch the environment to ensure global packages aren't changed:

`$ pipenv shell`

If using VSCode text editor, ensure correct Python interpreter is selected for your virtual environment or packages will not be found.
