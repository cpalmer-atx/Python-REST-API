These notes are for myself as I develope my own Python Flask/ REST API understanding.


Using PIPENV virtual environment with the following dependencies:
1. Flask
2. Flask-RESTful
3. Flask-JWT


launch PIPENV with $pipenv shell.


If using VSCode text editor, ensure correct Python interpreter is selected for your virtual environment or packages will not be found.
