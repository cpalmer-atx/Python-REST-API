REST API with Flask and Python
Credit: Jose Salvatierra - Teclado

About:
This simple REST API serves as my own springboard for other projects.  

Using PIPENV virtual environment with the following dependencies:
1. Flask
2. Flask-RESTful
3. Flask-JWT


launch PIPENV with $pipenv shell.


If using VSCode text editor, ensure correct Python interpreter is selected for your virtual environment or packages will not be found.
